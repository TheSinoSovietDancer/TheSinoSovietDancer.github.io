<h3>Day 1 - 8/13</h3>
<p>
    The beginning of a long journey to Warsaw, Poland. Took an early 7am flight to JFK, hung out at the airport until
    10pm before taking off on Polish airlines LOT and arriving at noon to Chopin International Airport.
</p>

<h3>Day 2 - 8/14 </h3>
<p>
    After figuring out how to exchange zlotys (conversion rate of ~ 4.4 zloty to 1usd) we ubered to the Intercontinental
    Warsaw. At the top of the hotel is a pool with a scenic view of the city. The hotel is conveniently located next to
    the Palace of Culture and Science, which was originally a gift from Stalin to promote Soviet achievements .

    After a stroll in the city, we decided to eat at this restaurant called Butcher & Wine. Polish food is definitely
    meat heavy, and we ordered steak, bone marrow, and two glasses of wine. We also got to try their traditional mead
    honey wine. After we checked out the Museum of Life under Communism and learned that PTO is actually a socialist
    concept to prevent workers from revolting.

</p>

<h3>Day 3 - 8/15 </h3>
<p>
    Consisted of a morning tour to Chopin Monument, and walk through key monuments like a statue of Ronald Regan that
    faces the US Embassy and eventually making our way to the Jewish History Museum. After walking through, we checked
    out the Warsaw Uprising Museum, which was free for everyone because of the polish national holiday. In the
    afternoon, we took a walk around Batory High school, and got dinner with a college classmate at Na Lato, a trendy
    restaurant near the Vistula River.

</p>

<h3>Day 4 - 8/16 </h3>
<p>
    Today we left Warsaw and drove through to the Janus Gora monastery in Czestochowa.
    The church itself was beautiful and ordained with gold.

    After another hour of driving, we arrived in Krakow at the Mecure. We tried traditional
    Polish cuisine at Pod Aniołami Restaurant (Restauracja Pod Aniołami). The meal consisted of wine, pierogies
    (dumplings), and trout. After meeting another college classmate, we walked through Old Town and grabbed a drink by
    the river.

<!-- <li>Swan Lake's Place in Soviet/Russian History</li>
<p>
    <li>Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake</li>
    When Swan Lake first premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre, the ballet was considered a failure.
    No one would have thought that the ballet now exists in the reproitoire of every ballet company.
</p>

<p>
    <li>Soviet Swan Lake
    <li>
        During this time, Swan Lake functioned as a form of state propoganda. The ballet marked important events in
        history
        like the deaths of great leaders. The ballet was also performed abroad to promote Soviet ideologies as a battle
        between good (socialism)
        and evil (capitalism).
</p>

<p>
    <li>Modern Swan Lake
    <li>
        Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Swan Lake has been reclaimed by political dissidents to protest the Russian
        government.
        Russian news outlets opposed to the war broadcasted Swan Lake as a reference to the fall of the Soviet Union
        when the theme was played on loop.
