<li>Swan Lake's Place in Soviet/Russian History</li>
<p> 
    <li>Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake</li>
    When Swan Lake first premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre, the ballet was considered a failure. 
    No one would have thought that the ballet now exists in the reproitoire of every ballet company.

<p><li>Soviet Swan Lake<li>
    During this time, Swan Lake functioned as a form of state propoganda. The ballet marked important events in history 
    like the deaths of great leaders. The ballet was also performed abroad to promote Soviet ideologies as a battle between good (socialism)
    and evil (capitalism).

<p><li>Modern Swan Lake<li>
    Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Swan Lake has been reclaimed by political dissidents to protest the Russian government.
   Russian news outlets opposed to the war broadcasted Swan Lake as a reference to the fall of the Soviet Union when the theme was played on loop.
